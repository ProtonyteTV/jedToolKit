  "version": "25.5.0",
  "changelog": "This major update introduces jedOSSecuCheck 2.0, delivering stronger security with enhanced protection mechanisms to ensure modules remain safe and resilient against tampering. In addition, this release debuts jedXIP, a new archive manager that allows users to fully create, view, and edit ZIP files directly within jedToolKit, expanding its utility beyond diagnostics.\n\nSeveral modules also receive significant quality-of-life improvements. jedPhoneInfo gains a new Advanced Features section highlighting ProMotion Display, Connector Type, Action Button, and Always-On Display information, as well as a toggle to view Optimistic vs Raw Storage. jedHWChecker makes hardware testing easier with automatic detection of volume button inputs, smarter camera detection with ultrawide and telephoto support, a relocated Battery Info section under Tools, and a brightness test that restores the userâ€™s previous brightness after completion. IconThemer improves customization with a new Find App Scheme feature and corrected logic for icon colors and glyphs, fixing issues from version 25.4.1.\n\nBeyond diagnostics, the update introduces a new jedPhoneInfo Widget for at-a-glance device information and finalizes the jedUI design by removing neon colors and shadows in favor of a flat, accent-supported interface with multi-color options. Finally, jedAI Beta 3 enhances the assistant with new commands for System Status, Storage Checking, Module Listing, Search, and Clear Chat, alongside UX improvements such as a typing indicator, rich text formatting, and contextual ask suggestions. Together, these enhancements make jedToolKit 25.5.0 one of the most feature-complete and secure releases yet.",
