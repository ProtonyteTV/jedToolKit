  "version": "2.0",
  "changelog": "This update includes important visual enhancements across all modules and introduces jedOSUpdateChecker — a new system-inspired interface for checking future updates to jedToolKit.

Version 2.0 also adds major new modules like jedPanicAnalyzer, which can intelligently parse iDevice panic logs, and jedAI, a barebones on-device assistant (Beta 1) that supports basic diagnostics and system checks.

You’ll also find expanded command support in jedTerminal Lite, full 2024 device compatibility in jedPhoneInfo, and critical layout fixes for iOS 26 (navigation bar no longer blocks titles).

This release includes various performance optimizations, memory usage improvements, and internal bug fixes for a faster and more stable experience.
