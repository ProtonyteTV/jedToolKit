  "version": "25.5.1",
  "changelog": "This major update introduces jedOSSecuCheck 3.0, a next-generation security engine that provides a robust, multi-layered integrity system to protect all modules from tampering and unauthorized access. The centralized fail-safe ensures that any detected threat immediately triggers Lite Mode, preventing unsafe code from executing. Anti-debugging mechanisms, sandbox integrity validation, runtime verification, and code obfuscation reinforce the systemâ€™s resilience without exposing sensitive implementation details.\n\nAll previous enhancements from 25.5.0 are fully integrated: jedPhoneInfo adds Advanced Features (ProMotion Display, Connector Type, Action Button, Always-On Display) with a toggle for Optimistic vs Raw Storage; jedHWChecker improves hardware testing with automatic volume button detection, smarter camera tests including ultrawide and telephoto, relocated Battery Info, and brightness restoration; IconThemer adds Find App Scheme and fixes color/glyph logic for SF Symbols; jedPhoneInfo Widget allows at-a-glance device info; jedUI finalizes a flat, clean interface with accent colors and multi-color support; and jedAI Beta 3 introduces new commands (System Status, Check Storage, List Modules, Search, Clear Chat) alongside rich text formatting and typing indicator UX improvements.\n\nTogether, these updates make jedToolKit 25.5.1 the most secure, reliable, and feature-complete release yet.",
