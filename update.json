  "version": "25.4.1",
  "changelog": "This minor but critical update addresses a major issue with the IPSW Download Helper, which previously caused crashes during downloads and lacked proper storage space checks. The system now verifies available device storage before downloading IPSW files and correctly saves them to the jedToolKit Apps folder cache, preventing app instability and ensuring smoother IPSW handling. In addition, this patch introduces SHA256 integrity verification for all IPSW downloads. After each download, the system automatically computes and validates the fileâ€™s SHA256 checksum against the official value from Apple. If a mismatch is detected, the file is discarded and re-downloaded until a verified and intact copy is obtained. This ensures that only authentic and error-free IPSW files are stored, eliminating risks of silent data corruption.\n\nThis patch focuses solely on stabilizing the download experience and laying the groundwork for future enhancements to IPSW management within jedToolKit.",
