        Effective Date: June 29, 2025

        1. Introduction
        Welcome to jedToolKit Lite. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app. This app is designed to operate without collecting any personal data from you.

        2. Data Collection
        We do NOT collect:
        â€¢ Personal information (name, email, phone number)
        â€¢ Usage analytics
        â€¢ Device identifiers
        â€¢ Location data (unless explicitly required and permitted by you)

        Local Access Only:
        Some tools like jedPhoneInfo, jedHWChecker, and IPSW Downloader access system data locally to function. Nothing is ever sent outside your device.

        3. Permissions Used
        â€¢ Photos Access: Used only if you pick an image for icon theming via IconThemer. Your image is never uploaded.
        â€¢ Wi-Fi / Network Info: Used to show your current connection (e.g. in jedTSSChecker).
        â€¢ Camera & Microphone: Used by jedHWChecker to test those components.
        â€¢ File Access: Used to save .mobileconfig or IPSW files. No data leaves the device unless shared manually.

        4. Third-Party Access
        jedToolKit Lite does NOT use:
        â€¢ Analytics SDKs
        â€¢ Advertising frameworks
        â€¢ Tracking or crash logging tools
        The only server communication happens with Appleâ€™s public services (e.g. IPSW.me).

        5. Data Security
        Because we donâ€™t store or transmit personal data, your information stays completely private and local.

        6. Changes to This Policy
        This policy may be updated from time to time. Important changes will be noted in the changelog or during updates.

        7. Contact

        â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
        âœ… Your data stays with you.
        jedToolKit is built to be transparent, offline-first, and respectful of your deviceâ€™s privacy.

        Thank you for using jedToolKit Lite!
